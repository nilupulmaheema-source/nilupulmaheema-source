### Hi, I'm Nilupul. 👋
**Visual Storyteller | Electronic Engineer**

I use engineering logic to control creative AI tools.

Coming from a background in Electronics and Pre-Sales, I don't just "write" prompts—I build them like code. I treat Generative AI as a system with parameters that need to be tuned, not just a magic box. My goal is to get consistent, specific results that match a client's brief, rather than just random pretty images.

**My Stack:**
* **Tech:** Python, Machine Learning, Automation
* **GenAI:** Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Kling AI (Video), Stable Diffusion
* **Focus:** Character Consistency, Narrative Sequencing, Prompt Logic

**Why an Engineer for Creative Work?**
* **I understand "Computer Vision":** My research on autonomous drones (using YOLO models) taught me how machines interpret images. I know how to speak the model's language to get the composition I want.
* **I build what clients actually need:** In my previous role at Tyax, my job was translating vague customer requests into precise technical Bills of Materials. I do the same thing here: translating vague creative ideas into precise visual outputs.
